# PyBer Analysis

## Overview (The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt))
As a Data Anlalyst PyBer, I was asked to do an exploratory analysis of ride share data over a variety of city types; Urban, Suburban and Rural. As part of the analysis, I had to inspect and merge the data set, group and analyize the se, as well as plot the data to to tell a visual story for the stakeholders at PyBer. 

## Results (There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

From my analysis, I was able to determine the following differences by city type: 

### Urban
* Urban cities saw more rides and more drivers than in either of the two city types (See Fig.1 below)
* Urban cities had the highest profits of the city types
* There are more drivers than riders int he city, causing a lower per driver average fare

### Suburban
* The number of rides and drivers arecloser together for Suburban areas. There is a good profit, and a mid range average fare for both riders and drivers as seen below: 

### Rural
* Rural cities saw fewer rides, fewer drivers, but higher fares 

## Summary and Recommendations (There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt))
