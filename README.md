# PyBer Analysis

## Overview 
As a Data Analyst at PyBer, I was asked to do an exploratory analysis of ride share data over a variety of city types; Urban, Suburban and Rural. As part of the analysis, I had to inspect and merge the data set, group and analyze  the set, as well as plot the data to tell a visual story for the stakeholders at PyBer. The following are my results and recommendations for increasing profits at PyBer.

## Results 

From my analysis of the data laid out in the Ride Share Summary below, I was able to determine the following differences by city type. My analysis is supported further by the charts and summaries provided immediately following the results by city type.

### Urban Cities
* Urban cities saw more rides and more drivers than both Rural and Suburban city types (See Figure 1 below)
* Urban cities had the highest percentage of profits of the city types (See Figure 5 and Figure 6 below)
* There are more drivers than riders in Urban cities, resulting in a lower per driver average fare (See Ride Share Data Summary Above)

### Suburban Cities
* The number of rides and drivers are closer together for Suburban areas. (See Ride Share Data Summary Above)
* There is a higher profit percentage from Suburban areas over Rural (See Figure 5 and Figure 6 below)
* Suburban cities fall in between Urban and Rural cities when it comes to average fare for both riders and drivers (See Ride Share Data Summary Above)

### Rural Cities
* Rural cities saw fewer rides and fewer drivers than any other city type (See Figures 6 and 7 below)
* Rural cities saw higher fares for both riders and drivers than any other city type (See Ride Share Data Summary Above)

## Recommendations 

After reviewing the data the following are recommendations to the CEO to help increase profits as well as offer driver support across city types. 

<ol>
<li>Send drivers from Urban areas to Suburban and Rural areas. This will help increase the average fare per driver for Urban drivers, and bring down the cost of fare per ride for riders which can encourage more Rural ridership and higher profits in those cities. </li>

<li>Increase rates at peak times. For example increasing rates in late Feb and early April as evidenced in the Pyber Fare Summary chart below would allow PyBer to capture additional revenues at times when ridership is high.</li>

<li>Increase the per mile cost for Urban trips. These trips due to proximity of places in Urban cities tend to be shorter, and will allow the drivers and PyBer to make additional profit where there is the most ridership.</li>
